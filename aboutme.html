									<h2> Career </h2>
																		<p> I'm Peter Tran an Associate to the Associate Digital Sanitation Specialist (ie Associate Security Engineer) specializing in incident response and crying at my desk after work. As a recent (fairly) graduate and current alumni of Virginia Commonwealth University, I'm excited to start off my career in cybersecurity and technology. I have a passion for fixing broken things and good old fashion investigative work and I found that cybersecurity was a fun niche that intersects with both. In school I competed in several security competitions such as MACCDC and MetaCTF, and met some great friends traveling around to them. Having a chance to talk to other likeminded people in the security space has really driven my passion in this field and I'm always on the search for new and interesting challenges to overcome. I've learned a lot in my short journey so far and wanted to use this website as a fun project to both document cool things I'm working on as well as a fun way to get my hands dirty with AWS, especially serverless architecture. </p>
									<h2> Interests </h2>
																		<p> Besides messing around with AWS and security stuff, I'm also interested in hiking, tennis, food, and the usual list of hobbies Millennials are into. I am also a big history, business, and politics buff and I love exploring the intersection of all three and how it shapes the world we live in. Seeing how decisions made effects the lives of regular people helps to humanize the world and makes for great stories. I am especially interested in the history and culture of other countries and I hope to get to travel and experience some of that the rich and vibrant history other places have to offer. I am also <i>trying</i> to get into running and hope to run a sub 8 minute mile but I'm not holding my breath for that happening anytime soon. </p>
									<h2> About the Blog </h2>
																		<p> This project started off as a way for me to build a static website in AWS but has grown into a creative outlet for me. I look forward to being able to write short, quick articles to pass the time and share my thoughts and various subjects like business news, tech, pop culture, or random history facts. I chose to try an build everything out myself over writing posts on Medium because I wanted to have the creative control and painful fun of hosting it myself. After some experimentation I was able to slap a sample HTML template onto an S3 bucket and point a CloudFront distribution at it to create the site you're on now. I'm still exploring different options to setup the actually blog and articles. In particular I'm looking at using <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> since a coworker of mine uses it to host his <a href="https://blog.michaelbanks.org/manage-a-serverless-blog/">blog</a>. There's still some kinks I need to work out before I can set that up but I hope to figure out these challenges and do a little writeup. </p>
