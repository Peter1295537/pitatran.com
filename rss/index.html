As a recent-ish alumni of Virginia Commonwealth University, I'm excited to start off my career in cybersecurity and tech. I have a passion for fixing broken things and good old fashion investigative work and I found that cybersecurity was a fun niche that intersects with both. In school I competed in several security competition and met some great friends along the way. Having a chance to talk to other like minded people in the security space has really driven my passion in this field and I'm always on the search for new and interesting challenges to overcome. I've learned a lot in my short journey so far and wanted to use this website as a fun project to both document cool things I'm working on as well as a fun way to get my hands dirty with AWS!</p><h2 id="interests">Interests</h2><p>Besides messing around with AWS and security stuff, I'm also interested in hiking, tennis, food, and the usual list of hobbies Millennials/Zoomers are into. I am also a big history, business, and politics buff and I love exploring the intersection of all three and how it shapes the world we live in. Seeing how decisions made by a few people effects the lives of ordinary people from all walks of life helps to humanize the world and makes for compelling stories. I am especially interested in the history and culture of other countries and I hope to get to travel and hear some of those stories. I am also <em>trying</em> to get into running/fitness and hope to run a sub 8 minute mile but I'm not holding my breath for that happening anytime soon.</p><h2 id="about-the-blog">About the Blog</h2><p>This project started off as a way for me to build a static website in AWS but has grown into a creative outlet for me to share my thoughts and practice writing. I look forward to being able to write short, quick articles to pass the time to discuss various subjects like business news, tech, pop culture, or random history facts.</p><p>I chose to try and build everything out myself over writing posts on Medium because I wanted to have the creative control and experience the painful fun of hosting it myself. So far it's been a fun experience that's allowed me to experiment with different services in AWS. After some experimentation I was able to slap a sample HTML template onto an S3 bucket and point a CloudFront distribution at it to create a basic static site. </p><p>After exploring different options for how to manage the blog itself I have opted to use <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> since a coworker of mine uses it to host his <a href="https://blog.michaelbanks.org/manage-a-serverless-blog/">blog</a>. With the "hard" part out of the way I hope to start sharing my thoughts and writing articles!</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
